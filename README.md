This project builds machine learning models that try to predict whether a claim can be supported, refuted, or there is insufficient information
to determine this based on existing and new predictors in the FEVER (Fact Extraction and VERification) dataset. The models compared are logistic regression
with LASSO regularization, K-Nearest Neighbors, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest.
